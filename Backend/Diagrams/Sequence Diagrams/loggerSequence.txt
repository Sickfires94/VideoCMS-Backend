    App->>Serilog: Configure Logger(with RabbitMQ Sink)
    App->> Serilog: LogEvent(message, properties...)
    activate Serilog
    Serilog->>RMQ_Sink: Pass LogEvent to Sink
    activate RMQ_Sink
    RMQ_Sink->>RabbitMQ: Publish LogEvent(as JSON message)
    activate RabbitMQ
    RabbitMQ-->>RMQ_Sink: Acknowledge Message Receipt
    deactivate RabbitMQ
    RMQ_Sink-->>Serilog: Confirm(internally handled)
    deactivate RMQ_Sink
    Serilog-->>App: (Continues execution)
    deactivate Serilog

    Note over RabbitMQ, LogShipper: RabbitMQ acts as a buffer and queue.

    LogShipper->>RabbitMQ: Subscribe to Log Queue
    activate LogShipper
    RabbitMQ->>LogShipper: Deliver LogEvent Message
    LogShipper->>LogShipper: (Parse, Transform, Enrich LogEvent)
    LogShipper->>Elasticsearch: Bulk Index LogEvent (HTTP/S POST)
    activate Elasticsearch
    Elasticsearch-->>LogShipper: Acknowledge Indexing
    deactivate Elasticsearch
    LogShipper-->>RabbitMQ: Acknowledge Message Processed
    deactivate LogShipper

    Note right of Elasticsearch: Kibana(or other tools) queries Elasticsearch for visualization and analysis.
